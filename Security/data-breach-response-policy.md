## Data Breach Response Policy

### Purpose 

The purpose of the policy is to establish the goals and the vision for the breach response process in the MYRTLECONSULTING S.A. ("we" or "Mddocs"). This policy will clearly define to whom it applies and under what circumstances, and it will include the definition of a breach, staff roles and responsibilities, standards and metrics (e.g., to enable prioritization of the incidents), as well as reporting, remediation, and feedback mechanisms. The policy shall be well publicized and made easily available to all personnel whose duties involve data privacy and security protection.

Mddocs Information Security's intentions for publishing a Data Breach Response Policy are to focus significant attention on data security and data security breaches and how Mddocs’s established culture of openness, trust and integrity should respond to such activity. Mddocs Information Security is committed to protecting Mddocs's employees, partners and the company from illegal or damaging actions by individuals, either knowingly or unknowingly.

### Background

This policy mandates that any individual who suspects that a theft, breach or exposure of Mddocs Protected data or Mddocs Sensitive data has occurred must immediately provide a description of what occurred via email to support@mddocs.io or using other options mentioned on the [Contact Us](https://docs.mddocs.io/contact-us) web page. This email address and Mddocs's issue tracker are monitored by the Mddocs’s Support Team. The team will investigate all reported thefts, data breaches and exposures to confirm if a theft, breach or exposure has occurred. If a theft, breach or exposure has occurred, the Mddocs's Support Team will follow the appropriate procedure in place.

### Scope

This policy applies to all whom collect, access, maintain, distribute, process, protect, store, use, transmit, dispose of, or otherwise handle personally identifiable information of Mddocs members and end users. 

### Policy Confirmed theft, data breach or exposure of Mddocs Protected data or Mddocs Sensitive data

As soon as a theft, data breach or exposure containing Mddocs Protected data or Mddocs Sensitive data is identified, the process of removing all access to that resource will begin. The Mddocs Suport team will handle the breach or exposure. The team will analyze the breach or exposure to determine the root cause and work with Mddocs communications, legal and human resource departments to decide how to communicate the breach to: a) internal employees, b) the public, and c) those directly affected.

### Enforcement 

Any Mddocs personnel found in violation of this policy may be subject to disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment. Any third party partner company found in violation may have their network connection terminated.
